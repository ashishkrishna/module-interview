This represents some of the core math that goes on deep in the process of simulating a solar photovoltaic array.  Our intent with this exercise is not to look for pure algorithmic skill, or to filter for people who love doing math, but simply as an interesting and relevant context to see how you structure and test your code/algorithms.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\n\r\nTo determine the electrical output of solar photovoltaic panels (called solar modules in the industry), the standard approach is to use a mathematical formulation based on the [Shockley Diode Equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode#Shockley_diode_equation).  The specific formulation for a given solar panel is:\r\n\r\nThe single diode equation is given by:\r\n\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n    I=I_{sc}\\cdot S - I_0(T)\\left(e^{\\frac{q}{kTa}\\left(V+I \\cdot R_s\\right)}-1\\right)-\\frac{V+I \\cdot R_s}{R_p}\r\n\\end{equation}\r\n\r\nHere, _I<sub>0</sub>(T)_ is defining a function that causes the output of a solar panel to change slightly as temperature changes (all other things equal, at higher temperatures a module will output at about the same current, but a lower voltage).  This function is given by:\r\n\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n    I_0(T)=I_0\\left(1+\\tau\\right)^{T-25}\r\n\\end{equation}\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of these coefficients are determined from published specifications, so that ultimately you can plug in variables for sunlight, _S_ (technically this is called irradiance), and temperature, _T_.  Once sunlight and temperature have been plugged voltage (_V_), and current (_I_)  are the only remaining factors â€“ so after plugging everything in, this equation defines the output curve of a solar panel.\r\n\r\n![module IV Curve](http://www.folsomlabs.com/modeling/modeling/moduleIV.jpg)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
